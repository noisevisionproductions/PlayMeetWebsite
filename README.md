# About PlayMeet Website

I decided to create a web version of the PlayMeet app so I could learn more about Spring Boot. Even at first, I was overwhelmed by stuff that I needed to know and Spring Boot annotations were like black magic to me. in the long run, I think it was a great choice. I had to learn not only Spring but also HTML and CSS along with that for better design. I tried not to touch JavaScript but it was also almost impossible, in the end, I touched the basics of it. Thanks to documentation and my trial and error, I know more about Spring Boot and I admire its simplicity and speed for coding web apps.
Putting aside the amount of knowledge I had to have, I knew that one day I needed to know more about code testing in Java. That's why in this project I created my first unit tests using JUnit and Mockito and started to play with them.

# Features

For now, I'm mirroring functionality from my Android app in order to understand Spring Boot. Because of that, I could learn more about data integration and synchronicity, because in both instances I'm using Firebase products (Realtime Database, Firestore, Auth, Storage).

## Design

In the beginning, I knew nothing about front-end so I generated HTML and CSS code with the help of Chat-GPT, but with time, as I started to play along with his examples, by nature I understood it more, and day by day I became comfortable with creating my own design, but I still prefer to spend more time perfecting back-end.
